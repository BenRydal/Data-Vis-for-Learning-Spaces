Sketch 2 will continue to familiarize you with Processing. Specifically, you will draw one type of movement (Brownian motion) over abstract/unstructured space. Some code in this sketch draws insights from the fantastic Dan Shiffman, see: https://shiffman.net

SPECIFIC LEARNING GOALS:
1) Declare/understand global variables and arrays/lists
2) Understand for loops/loops
3) Draw Brownian motion & consider movement across abstract/unstructured space
4) Understand the role/power of functions
