Sketch 3 will continue to familiarize you with Processing while also beginning to demonstrate the value of data visualization to study and design different types of learning spaces. Specifically, you will draw/hypothesize people's movement over different types of floor plans.


SPECIFIC LEARNING GOALS:
1) Begin to understand program organization through tabs
2) Understand ArrayLists/lists & data loading from files
3) Use MousePressed/KeyPressed functions (i.e., learn about graphical user interface (GUI) functions)
4) Draw, compare and contrast qualities of movement in different types of physical spaces
5) Discuss/consider what physical movement suggests about how people learn
4) Download an image of a personally relevant learning space from the internet and load that image into this program
6) Compare/contrast movement in your personally relevant learning space with others
