Sketch 4 shifts from focusing on data and learning in indoor spaces to outdoor spaces (in this case, New York City). Specifically, you will load different digital maps, a data set concerning New York City's Stop-And-Frisk Program, and draw movement over these maps and data. Before running Sketch 4, make sure you have downloaded and placed the unfolding maps library folder (included in the introductory message of this tutorial) in the Processing "libraries folder" located within your processing folder on your computer.

SPECIFIC LEARNING GOALS:
1) Understand, discuss the value of libraries
2) Draw, scale, zoom and pan a digital map
3) Run your sketch with a different "map provider"
4) Open/analyze the friskData_2015.csv file (in the data folder) in Microsoft Excel or a similar program. This data set is freely available from the New York City Police Department and contains data about stops conducted as part of New York City's Stop-And-Frisk Program during the year 2015.
5) Load and visualize this data set across New York City
6) If you live in New York, draw your movement over one day or a week (your "daily/weekly round") over this data set and map
6) Discuss the use of a "basemap" to contextualize/interpret data
7) Compare/contrast spatial terminology at indoor vs. outdoor scales
