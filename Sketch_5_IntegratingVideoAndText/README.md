Sketch 5 will illustrate how to create a simple video player in Processing to watch and analyze a 2 minute video of classroom interaction. This video shows the teaching of a key idea in the physics of matter—that matter occupies space—in a kindergarten-first grade classroom. Prior to running this program please make sure you have downloaded this video and place it within the "data" folder in this sketch: https://gatech.box.com/s/vxmd84fgjg5qfr4za9b49vebhpyzlhge

3) Load strings/visualize conversation
4) Interact/study video and text simultaneously
5) Consider the role of talk in this classroom, what is being learned and how do we know?
6) Consider what else you could/would like to visualize to study interactions in spaces like this
