Sketch 5 will illustrate how to create a simple video player in Processing to watch and analyze a 2 minute video of classroom interaction. This video shows the teaching of a key idea in the physics of matter—that matter occupies space—in a kindergarten-first grade classroom. 

BEFORE RUNNING THIS SKETCH:
1) In Processing, go to Sketch--Import Library--Add Library and add the "Video | GStreamer-based video library for Processing."
2) Place the video downloaded at the beginning of this tutorial (https://gatech.box.com/s/vxmd84fgjg5qfr4za9b49vebhpyzlhge) into the data folder in this processing sketch

SPECIFIC LEARNING GOALS:
1) Further understand program organization through tabs
2) Read/import/play/pause video
3) Load strings/visualize conversation
4) Interact/study video and text simultaneously
5) Consider the role of talk in this classroom, what is being learned and how do we know?
6) Consider what else you could/would like to visualize to study interactions in spaces like this
