# Data-Vis-for-Learning-Spaces
Hi! This is a repository of code examples and instructions for an introductory workshop about data visualization for learning spaces. This workshop also introduces participants to data visualization with the Processing Programming Language and Unfolding Maps Library. This workshop was developed in collaboration with the EdLab at Teachers College, Columbia University. Check out some of the EdLab's amazing work at: https://edlab.tc.columbia.edu
